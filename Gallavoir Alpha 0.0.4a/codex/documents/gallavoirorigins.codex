    "Not much has been written down of Gallavoir history. Mythology has been passed from generation to generation of an escape from a forsaken land with a beam of light, but what is not a myth is what happened less than one hundred years ago.",
	
	"The Gallavoir, living in peaceful coexistence with their home-worlds fauna, were visited by an Apex exploration party. Never having seen such strange creatures, the Gallavoir offered feasts in respect for their visitors. Though they did not speak the same language, an agreement was made to bring a handful of Gallavoir off-world.",
	
	"These Gallavoir were taken across the galaxy, to an outpost of the Miniknog, and locked away in solitary rooms. Over the course of several weeks, experiments were run by the Miniknog on this new race. According to the tests ran, there seemed to be latent psionic abilities that the Gallavoir were using subconsciously to affect the emotions of those who came in close proximity.",
	
	"Such a discovery seemed to pique the interest of the Miniknog. The Gallavoir were subjected to treatment in the VEP. Most of the Gallavoir who entered into the VEP died a grotesque death. Two (one male and one female), however, survived the process and broke out of the VEP chambers.",
	
	"What came out of the VEP were Gallavoir with enhanced psionic abilities, lengthened arms with elbow blades, and a bone to pick with their captors. Using their new-found psychic and combat prowess, the new Gallavoir tore through the base until they stumbled upon me.",
	
	"I was one of the Apex scientists that the Miniknog had assigned to monitor the experiments over the Gallavoir. From the beginning, I was repulsed to see how the Miniknog were treating them but felt I could do nothing about it, so I resolved myself to finding subtle ways to sabotage the experiments.",
	
	"When the Gallavoir broke out of the VEP chambers and tore through the Miniknog base, I suppose it was fate for them to run across me. Though the male held his elbow blades to my throat, the female calmed him down and read my emotions, as she later told me. I agreed to help them escape this wretched construct and return them to their home-world.",
	
	"After deleting all file references to the Gallavoir and their home-world, we broke into the ship hangar and stole the cargo ship which once brought the group of their kind here, after first disabling its tracking devices and storing many Apex weapons and armours on it.",

	"It has been many years since what happened on that base. Gardevoir, as the female Gallavoir preferred be called, and her male companion, Gallade, came to become the leaders of their people. With my help, they reverse-engineered Apex technology and established a guerilla war against the Miniknog and Big Ape. They established diplomatic relations with other races.",
	
	"It has been many years since then, with a few generations now growing used to the nomadic nature of this guerilla war against the Apex. The children of Gardevoir and Gallade serve as the leaders of the Gallavoir throughout the galaxy. Perhaps, one day, Big Ape will be brought down by a Gallavoir."

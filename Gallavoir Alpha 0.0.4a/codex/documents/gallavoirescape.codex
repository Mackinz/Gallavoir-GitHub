  "After successfully negotiating with the Hylotl for many things, you were in high spirits. Your ship was filled with a supply of freshly harvested Coralcreep and various metals. Everything changed when an unidentified enemy ship attacked. Lacking a laser weapon on-ship, your ship was helplessly bombarded with blue beams of destruction, starting fires which destroyed the food stores and most of the on-board resources.",
  
  "After directing your ship though a solar system and losing the attacker, you disabled the automatic ship hailer and put out the fires. With what few resources you have in storage, it is time to set out and find the bastard that did this."
